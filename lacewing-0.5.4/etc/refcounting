This file contains notes about the refcounting system used in liblacewing.


lw_server
=========

* Creates an fdstream for each client when connected.  Retains a ref.

* Releases ref on stream close

* When calling out to user code (hooks):
    
    - Retain an extra ref on the client fdstream

    - Call the hook

    - Release the ref.  If lwp_release returned true or lwp_stream_flag_dead
      is set, the client is gone and we should return immediately.
